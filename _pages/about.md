I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics at the University of Birmingham. 

Before coming to Birmingham, I was a Postdoc at Aarhus University from September 2021 -- September 2024 working in the group of Prof. Claudia Strauch. I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at the University of Mannheim in September 2021.
