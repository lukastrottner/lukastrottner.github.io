I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/mathematics). In October I will join the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.isa.uni-stuttgart.de/en/) as an Assistant Professor in Mathematical Statistics.

Before coming to Birmingham, I was a Postdoc at [Aarhus University](https://math.au.dk/en/) from September 2021 -- September 2024 working in the research group of [Prof. Claudia Strauch](https://ssp.math.uni-heidelberg.de). I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.wim.uni-mannheim.de/en/) in September 2021 under the supervision of [Prof. Leif Döring](https://www.wim.uni-mannheim.de/doering/).

<b>Research interests:</b> Statistics for stochastic processes, concentration of measure, transfer learning, MCMC, generative models, data-driven stochastic optimal control, high-dimensional statistical inference, Lévy processes and Markov additive processes.

If you are interested in doing a PhD with me, please get in touch via email.
